          We are LEAP!, a.k.a. Loving our Emotions
          <br />
          as Asians & Pacific !slanders. We are a
          <br />
          club committed to mental health wellness
          <br />
          & awareness within API communities,
          <br />
          especially here at UCR. We feel it's
          <br />
          important we break cultural stigmas of
          <br />
          mental health to allow us to achieve a
          <br />
          strong & healthy well-being, both in mind
          <br />
          & body. With this, we hope to create a
          <br />
          safe & welcoming space to talk about our
          <br />
          emotions and experiences to grow
          <br />
          ourselves in every way.
